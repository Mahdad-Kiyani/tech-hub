## 🔧 What I Build on Azure

### 1. ⚙️ Platform Engineering
- Azure Landing Zones via **CAF Terraform Modules**
- Hub-Spoke Networking, Private Link & DNS Zones
- Centralized **Log Analytics** and Defender for Cloud setup
- Azure Monitor alerts connected to Teams/Slack via Logic Apps

### 2. 📦 Data Engineering Pipelines
- **Azure Data Factory** with dynamic parameterized pipelines
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for data warehousing & big data queries
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** (zoned architecture: raw → curated → serving)
- **Azure Event Hub**, **Service Bus**, **Kafka on HDInsight** for event ingestion
- **Delta Lake** and **Apache Spark pools** for transformation & ML workflows

### 3. 🔄 Automation & DevOps
- CI/CD with Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions
- ARM/Bicep/Terraform provisioning with modules per environment
- Full lifecycle automation of ADF, Synapse, Purview via YAML pipelines
- Secrets integration with **Azure Key Vault**
- Versioning via Git tags & CI-based rollback pipelines

### 4. 🛡️ Governance & Security
- **Azure Policy** & **Blueprints** for compliance enforcement
- Defender for Cloud, Security Center & RBAC tagging strategies
- Centralized **Key Vault & Managed Identity** setup
- Least privilege access with PIM & Conditional Access
- Resource locks, budget alerts, and policy-as-code

---

## 📊 Monitoring, Cost & Efficiency

- Custom **Azure Cost Management** dashboards with tagging & chargeback
- **Log Analytics**, **App Insights**, and custom KQL scripts for root cause analysis
- Efficiency metrics: autoscaling, consumption model optimization
- Reserved instances planning with real-time usage analysis

## 🧠 Strategic Cloud Design Principles I Follow

1. **Zonal Data Architecture**: Raw → Curated → Serving zones using storage lifecycle rules  
2. **CI/CD-Driven Infrastructure**: DevOps-first mindset, reproducibility, and automation  
3. **Policy-as-Code**: Everything including naming standards, tags, and compliance is governed  
4. **Security by Default**: No public IPs by default, zero-trust networking, identity-first access  
5. **Scalable-by-Design**: Event-based scaling and horizontal scaling defaults  
6. **Cost Optimization Embedded**: Autoscale, reserved instances, serverless-first

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- 🔄 Migration of legacy SSIS to **ADF-Synapse** pipelines with CI/CD  
- 🧬 Centralized data governance via **Purview + RBAC** automation  
- 🔐 Deploying AKS with private ingress, Dapr sidecars, and KEDA-based scaling  
- ⚙️ Running Spark notebooks at scale for ETL and ML via **Synapse Pipelines**  
- 📡 Streaming architecture with Event Hub + Stream Analytics + Cosmos DB  
- 📈 Monitoring all subscriptions via a centralized **KQL + Log Analytics** setup

---

## 📈 Sample Metrics I Monitor

- Data throughput (MB/s) in Event Hub & ADF
- Integration runtime scaling efficiency in ADF  
- Job failure/retry ratios for Spark & Synapse  
- Alert heatmaps (alerts per region/service)  
- Power BI Embedded refresh times per report  
- Storage tier optimization across blob tiers
